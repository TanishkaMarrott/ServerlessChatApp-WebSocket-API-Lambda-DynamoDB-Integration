## Build a Serverless Chat Application on AWS  🚀
DynamoWave Chat is a serverless, real-time chat application powered by AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and WebSocket API. This project is designed with a focus on system design principles, ensuring high availability, scalability, security, cost-optimization, and top-notch performance.

### Features

#### Real-time Communication 💬
DynamoWave Chat leverages WebSocket API to enable seamless real-time communication, providing users with an interactive and engaging chat experience.

#### Serverless Architecture 🌐
The entire architecture is serverless, utilizing AWS Lambda for compute, DynamoDB for a NoSQL database, and WebSocket API for handling real-time connections. This ensures automatic scaling, reducing operational overhead and costs.

### System Design 

#### High Availability 🚀
With AWS services at its core, DynamoWave Chat inherits the high availability and fault-tolerance features of these services. DynamoDB, in particular, is designed for high availability with data replication across multiple Availability Zones.

#### Scalability 📈
The architecture is designed to scale horizontally, effortlessly handling an increasing number of users and messages. Auto-scaling features of Lambda and DynamoDB contribute to the system's ability to handle varying loads.

#### Security 🔐
IAM roles and policies are used to grant the least privilege access to resources. Lambda functions and DynamoDB tables are secured with fine-grained permissions, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

#### Cost-Optimization 💵
By adopting a serverless architecture, DynamoWave Chat optimizes costs through a pay-as-you-go model. DynamoDB's on-demand capacity and Lambda's event-driven model contribute to cost efficiency.

#### Performance Optimization ⚡
The use of DynamoDB provides low-latency data access, crucial for real-time applications. Additionally, AWS Lambda functions are designed for short-lived executions, contributing to low response times.

### System Architecture

_WebSocket API:_ Handles real-time bidirectional communication between clients and the backend.

_AWS Lambda:_ Executes functions in response to WebSocket events, managing chat-related logic.

_DynamoDB_: Stores and retrieves chat messages, ensuring scalability and low-latency access.
